You already have an example for Todos api (and each todo has category and user).
The application has a connection to postgre db.

1. Create a node.js express api (use chatgpt) to create and get transaction.
There should be two table in database, User and Transaction. User just has a name, transaction just has Amount, UserFrom, UserTo.
You should be able to create and get transactions.
It should store data in PostgreDB.

2. Test you application with Postman. That you are able to create and get transactions.
Verify that in PostgreDB you have this data.

3. Verify that you have foreign keys in your schemas.
4. Populate Transactions and Users with random data.

4. Write SQL queries (chatgpt can generate):
Get me the name of the user that has most money sent to.
Get me a sum how much money has been sent overall.
